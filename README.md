# Boisvert-ENT3320-Fall2020
**Tech Production - ENT 3320, D261 - Boisvert - From Social Dreaming to New Realities - Monday & Wednesdays 6-8:30 pm**

This course provides an opportunity for students to apply the skills they've acquired in the course of pursuing their degree to a collaboratively implemented project. We will work together to design and develop a beta-version of Circle of Salt, a mixed-reality sci fi comic book and game. Students will employ speculative design and world building to co-create an immersive experience that rewrites an alternative history &/or envisions an entirely new future state. Students will learn the foundations of the Unreal Engine, motion capture pipeline, procedural assets development, and real-time visual and sound effects. We will also explore how we can use game engines as a control system for live performance. Students will be broken into teams consistent with indie studios and follow an industry standard greenlight process: concept, design, development & launch. Students will share a playable version on Itch.io.

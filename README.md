# Boisvert-ENT3320-Fall2020
Tech Production - ENT 3320, D261 - Boisvert - From Social Dreaming to New Realities - Monday & Wednesdays 6-8:30 pm

Students will employ speculative design and world building to co-create an immersive experience that rewrites an alternative history &/or envisions an entirely new future state. Students will learn the foundations of the Unreal Engine, motion capture pipeline, procedural assets development, and real-time visual and sound effects. We will also explore how we can use game engines as a control system for live performance.
